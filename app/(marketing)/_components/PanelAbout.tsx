The team at Kaleidos, filled with frustration, couldn't find an intuitive and visually appealing tool to facilitate agile methodologies for both developers and designers. So, we did what was right. We decided to come up with a better tool and that's how Taiga's journey began! <br />
                                        In only a couple of years, Taiga was rolled out and immediately won "The Best Agile Tool‚Äù in the 2015 Agile Awards. Most recently, it was cited as one of the Top 7 project management tools for 2020 by OpenSource.com and it continues to be cited as one of the best agile project management tools with a worldwide footprint.

                            By the way, in case you're wondering, the name of Taiga comes after the boreal forest which lies across the subarctic region. It's strikingly beautiful from a distance but deadly if you enter the Taiga unprepared. A new project is like the Taiga forest, so we created our unique Taiga where you can start any project without any worry at all, we've got you covered. Just enjoy the Taiga!
